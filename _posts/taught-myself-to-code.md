I wish it were as easy as some magic list that, after you were done reading, could get a job as a developer. The truth is a bit more simple... consistency and discipline.

That's my actual desk, by the way. It's horribly ugly; I didn't even clean up to take that picture. Two coffee mugs, an empty bag of Haribo Starmix gummies, two mice (I can explain), an iPad on a 3D Printed phone stand... it's a mess, I know. Not important right now, okay?

## Unhappy.

---

I think any big career change, at least the ones that I've witnessed, stemmed from someone being _unhappy_. Unhappy with their current job prospects, unhappy with the amount of money they're making, unhappy with vertical or horiztonal growth opportunities... just unhappy.

My story is no different; In all of my previous jobs, I was unhappy. If you read [My Name Is Heath](/posts/my-name-is-heath), then you'll know that I have a degree in Petroleum Engineering, worked for a number of years as a Mechanical Design Engineer, and now am a Customer Success Engineer for an IoT startup. Up until this job with the startup, each job in my past has been more miserable than the last.

So, one day, I got tired of being tired and started to look around at what was our there. I asked myself:

> What could I teach myself, in a reasonable amount of time, where there is plenty of free-to-low-cost material online, that could pay as much (if not more) than my already pretty good engineer's salary?

I know, a lofty question. But there was really only one answer... Code.

## Where I Started.

Listen, I'm not the sharpest shed in the tool. Everyone has to start somewhere, and that's where I happened to start.

To be 100% with you, I didn't know that I wanted to be a developer. I just knew I wanted to work for a startup, and that most startups weren't hiring Mechanical Engineers with Petroleum Engineering backgrounds. They were hiring devlopers. So, that's where I started.

But what kind of developer did I want to be?

I read thread after thread on [r/learnprogramming](https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) on the types of software development available. Web? Embedded Systems? Backend? Frontend? Dev Ops? All of these options seemed to be viable, but one stuck out to me, as I did my reading, googling, and searching on places like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) and YouTube.
