## Why?

---

I grew up playing sports. At 4 years old I was playing tee ball, kicking dirt in the infield and catching bugs in the outfield. I played football, as well. I golfed, I tried soccer, and I even played basketball. I played _everything_. 

But baseball was my passion. I played baseball all through highschool. Select baseball every summer from the year I was 12 until just after my senior year of high school. I was even going to play college ball, but decided to hang up the cleats to focus on my degree. 

But it wasn't only sports, I'm an avid video game player. I had the original Xbox, Gamecube, PS2, a computer. I was a _very_ privilaged kid, and I'm very thankful for that.

I always wanted to be the **best**. I wanted to beat my opponent. I wanted to be better than them, and I wanted to be better than the next person. 

That had an effect on me. I wanted to not only wanted to read up on the latest strategies, but I wanted to practice day in and day out. I wanted to play more and more so I knew what to do in certain situations, to get that exprience. 

It also started to leak into my school work. I wanted to study more and get better test scores because I wanted to get better grades than my pier. 

When I stopped playing baseball in college, all of that changed. I joined a fraternity (which I do not regret in the slightest), I started drinking more, I was exercising less, and I gained weight (which I am still trying to get rid of). 

The people I spent my time with changed as well. I spent a lot of time in college just trying to fit in with everyone else and trying to be "good enough" for them to want to hang out with me. It was a bit jarring... I went from being well liked, or "popular, to not even someone's second or third choice to text when they were bored and were looking to hang out with someone. 

I should have been spending that time in college figuring out who I was and what I wanted to be, and maintaining my competitive personality... developing myself as an individual rather than trying to pander to people who wouldn't have ever pandered to me. 

## Bringing it back

---

So, this blog post is me bringing it back. This is me bringing back my competitive spirit, my will to learn and be better. 

But who will I be better than?

The simple, and only answer, is **myself**. 

I've gone too long being stuck in this... _complacency_ where I feel like I'm just okay to be living the life I have right now. 

A competitive mindset will push me to be a better version of myself in nearly every way. It will push me to be mindful about my actions and push me to start practicing more on the things I want to excel in.

## Changing my mindset

---

Okay, so, I've made this decision to "be more competitive" and "be better today than I was yesterday". 

**But how?**

I'll be honest. This is the part where I struggle the most. 

I struggle with maintaining will power and seeing things through (I bet you could tell by how infrequently I post to this blog). 

Here's what I plan on doing: 

1. Building time into my schedule. 
  - this means making time for not only personal project, but for things like "going on a walk" and dedicated time for personal projects and continuous learning
  - this is in hopes to at least be [1% better a day](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement)
1. Setting a 4 hour periodical text message to myself to remind myself to "Be competitive" and to "Win".
1. Spending _some_ time on the weekends evaulating my weekly progress. 
  - I'll do this by taking notes on my iPad and reviewing any notes I've taken throughout the week.
  - this is the "watch film on your opponent" I want to replace.

Hopefully folling these steps will keep me on track.

## Finally, the end. 

As I continute to improve myself, I'll be sure to come back to this post and update it with my improved process. 

I want to be better tomorrow than I am today, and I can only do that by taking small steps every day to improve myself and follow my passions and interests. 

Until the next one, stay curious.
