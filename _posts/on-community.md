title: "On Community"
excerpt: "As much as I love my alone time, humans are social creatures. Communities allow like-minded people to gather, communicate, interact, and grow towards a collective thought, idea, or action. Communities provide so much, but only when done right. I want to build one."

## What is a community? 

The [dictionary definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community) is actually pretty thorough. But, what I think that definition lacks, is what I think of what I hear "community". 

When I hear someone say "I'm a part of XYZ Community," or, "We should really grow our community," I think that it's a collective and inclusive group of people who are not only a group of people with common interests or professional goals, but rather a group of people with a innate and deep desire to **better themselves and help better others**.
