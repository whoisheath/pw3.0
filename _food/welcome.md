(That's not my actual kitchen. A real picture of my kitchen is coming soon!)

So, what is this? 

Well, it's a space where I post my recipes for meals as well as maybe some more in-depth stuff on what I want to make and how I want to make it. 

You know, maybe I want to soak jalape√±os in butter for a really long time, and then use that butter to make pancakes or something. Who knows? The possibilities are endless.

As always, as things come up in here that you may find interesting, the best way to get in contact with me is to [join my discord](https://discord.gg/yTvV8AymD5) and ask qeustions there!

Keep cooking!
