So, what is this? 

Well, it's a space where I post my recipes for meals as well as maybe some more in-depth stuff on what I want to make and how I want to make it. 

You know, maybe I want to soak jalape√±os in butter for a really long time, and then use that butter to make pancakes or something. Who knows? The possibilities are endless.
